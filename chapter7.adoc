== `Smsdia`: Supervisor Domain Interrupt Assignment

Interrupts that occur during the execution of a supervisor domain typically
cause a trap to the RDSM in M-mode by default. The RDSM may redirect traps
back to a supervisor domain using the `MRET` instruction. Additionally, the
RDSM may assert a _virtual interrupt_ to a supervisor domain. Such _virtual
interrupts_ might be asserted as part of handling a real interrupt, such as a
RAS interrupt, or they may have no direct connection to any actual interrupt
event.

To increase performance, the RDSM can delegate the handling of certain
interrupts, like the timer interrupt or the local performance counter
overflow interrupt (LCOFI), to the supervisor domain by setting the
appropriate `mideleg` bits. This delegation could necessitate the RDSM to
context switch additional state related to such delegated interrupts,
including `stimecmp` and the HPM CSRs.

Some supervisor domains may have devices assigned to them for I/O operations.
Devices designed to carry out I/O operations typically signal the completion
of an I/O task or an associated error via an external interrupt. These external
interrupts might be aggregated and indicated by an interrupt controller linked
to the RDSM. The RDSM, in the course of handling an external interrupt, should
forward the interrupt to the relevant supervisor domain. The efficiency of
handling external interrupts by a supervisor domain can be enhanced if the
external interrupts could be directly assigned to the supervisor domain <<SDI>>.
Such direct delivery of external interrupts necessitates a dedicated interrupt
controller that can be linked to such supervisor domains. To accommodate such
supervisor domains, the system might feature multiple interrupt controllers,
enabling an individual interrupt controller to be linked with each supervisor
domain. The interrupt controllers could be either an APLIC or an IMSIC, as
delineated by the RISC-V Advanced Interrupt Architecture (AIA) cite:[AIA]. In
certain systems, both an APLIC and an IMSIC could be linked with a supervisor
domain, with the APLIC configured to route interrupts to the associated IMSIC
as MSI. Interrupt controllers other than APLIC and/or IMSIC could also serve
a supervisor domain.

Although a variety of interrupt controllers can be activated for external
interrupts at the S- and VS-levels, a singular interrupt controller manages
external interrupts at the M-level and is perpetually active. The `Smsdia`
extension does not impact external interrupts at the M-level.

When an interrupt controller has an S-level external interrupt awaiting
resolution at the S-level on a hart, an S-level-external-interrupt-pending
signal is asserted. Certain interrupt controllers, like the IMSIC, support
delivering external interrupts directly to the VS-level. An IMSIC, for instance,
supports up to 63 guest interrupt register files, each potentially linked to a
virtual machine that the hypervisor might schedule for execution on a hart. Each
guest interrupt register file can assert a VS-level-external-interrupt-pending
signal when a VS-level external interrupt is pending resolution by a guest
operating at VS-level. With the introduction of supervisor domains, a multitude
of S-level and VS-level external interrupt pending signals might be asserted by
the various interrupt controllers connected to a hart.

Interrupt controllers are configured through a memory-mapped register interface,
a collection of CSRs, or a blend of both. For instance, software interfaces with
an APLIC via a memory-mapped register interface. In another case, software
interacts with an IMSIC through a set of S and VS-level CSRs, along with a
series of memory-mapped registers.

The `Smsdia` supports the connection of multiple interrupt controllers to a
hart, allowing a supervisor domain to be paired with one of these interrupt
controllers. The `Smsdia` extension uses the `msdcfg` CSR to signify the
active interrupt controller for a supervisor domain. When CSRs are employed to
interface with the interrupt controller state, they interact with the state
corresponding to the active interrupt controller.

The supervisor domain interrupt controllers connected to a hart may not be
identical. For example, each supervisor domain IMSIC may support a different
number of external interrupt identities for S- and/or VS-level, and the number
of guest interrupt files supported by each supervisor domain IMSIC may not be
identical.

Upon scheduling a supervisor domain for execution on a hart, the RDSM requires a
mechanism to appoint the linked interrupt controller as the active one for the
hart. Selecting an interrupt controller also chooses the linked S and VS-level
interrupt pending signals as those detected by the hart for instigating the
associated traps. When CSRs are utilized to interface with an interrupt
controller's state, the interaction is with the active interrupt controller.

The RDSM needs a method to be alerted if an external interrupt, whether at the
S- or VS-level, is pending for any supervisor domains not currently active on a
hart. The RDSM could leverage this notification to inform its scheduling
decisions. To facilitate this functionality, the `Smsdia` extension introduces
the `msdeip` and `msdeie` CSRs, along with an local supervisor domain external
interrupt (`LSDEI`).

=== Machine supervisor domain configuration (`msdcfg`)

The `msdcfg` is a 32-bit read/write register, formatted as shown in <<MSDCFG>>.

The `SDICN` field selects an interrupt controller among the plurality of
supervisor domain interrupt controllers associated with a hart as the active
supervisor domain interrupt controller for S- and VS-level external interrupts
when `SDICN` is the number of an implemented interrupt controller, not zero.

The `SDICN` field is a WLRL field that must be able to hold a value between 0
and the maximum implemented supervisor domain interrupt controller number,
inclusive. If there are no supervisor domain interrupt controllers connected to
the hart, then `SDICN` may be read-only zero.

When `SDICN` is not the number of an implemented interrupt controller, or is
zero then the following rules apply to all privilege modes:

* The S-level external interrupt pending signal indicated in `mip.SEIP` is 0.
* All non-custom values of `siselect` that access IMSIC registers designate an
  _inaccessible_ register. When `siselect` holds the number of an _inaccessible_
  register, attempts from M-mode or HS-mode to access `sireg` raise an illegal
  instruction exception.
* Access to CSR `stopei` raises an illegal instruction exception.
* The `hstatus.vgein` field is read-only zero.
* The VS-level external interrupt pending signals indicated in `hgeip` are 0.

When the interrupt controller selected by `msdcfg.SDICN` is an implemented
interrupt controller, and is not zero, and is an IMSIC, the following rules
apply:

* The S-level external interrupt pending signal of the selected IMSIC is
  indicated in `mip.SEIP`.
* The `siselect` and `stopei` CSRs operate on the registers of the S-level
  interrupt register file in the selected IMSIC when `siselect` holds a value
  that selects an IMSIC register.
* The VS-level external interrupt pending signals of the selected IMSIC are
  indicated in the `hgeip` CSR.
* The `hstatus.VGEIN` selects a guest interrupt file in the selected IMSIC and
  `vsiselect` and `vstopei` CSRs operate on the registers of the corresponding
  guest interrupt file in the selected IMSIC.

When the interrupt controller selected by `msdcfg.SDICN` is an implemented
interrupt controller, is not zero, and is an APLIC, the following rules apply:

* The S-level external interrupt pending signal of the selected APLIC is
  indicated in `mip.SEIP`.

[NOTE]
====
The `Smsdia` extension provides for directly associating an interrupt controller
with up to 63 supervisor domains. The RDSM may emulate interrupt controllers for
additional supervisor domains and `SDICN` is set to 0 for such supervisor
domains. To emulate an IMSIC, the RDSM may use the illegal instruction trap on
access to the associated CSRs for emulation purposes.
====

If `Smsdia` extension is implemented, then `msdcfg.SDICN` is non-zero at reset
and holds the number of an implemented supervisor domain interrupt controller.

=== Machine supervisor domain external interrupt pending (`msdeip/msdeiph`)

The `msdeip` is a MXLEN-bit read-only register, formatted for MXLEN=64 as
shown in <<MSDEIP>>. When MXLEN=32, `msdeiph` is a 32-bit read-only register
which aliases bits 63:32 of `msdeip`. When MXLEN=64, `msdeiph` does not exist.

  {bits:  1, name: '0'},
  {bits: 63, name: 'Interrupts'},
], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024}}
....

Each bit __i__ in the register summarizes the external interrupts pending in the
supervisor domain interrupt controller numbered __i__.

When the interrupt controller identified by __i__ is an APLIC, the bit __i__
indicates the state of the S-level external interrupt pending signal provided by
that APLIC.

When the interrupt controller identified by __i__ is an IMSIC, the bit __i__
indicates the logical OR of the S-level and all VS-level external interrupt
pending signals provided by that IMSIC.

The state of the supervisor domain interrupts is visible in the `msdeip`
register even when `msdcfg.SDICN` is zero or is not the valid number of an
implemented interrupt controller.

=== Machine supervisor domain external interrupt enable (`msdeie/msdeieh`)
The `msdeie` is a MXLEN-bit read-write register, formatted for MXLEN=64 as shown
in <<MSDEIE>>. When MXLEN=32, `msdeieh` is a 32-bit read-write register which
aliases bits 63:32 of `msdeie`. When MXLEN=64, `msdeieh` does not exist.

The `msdeie` CSR selects the subset of supervisor domain external interrupts
that cause a local supervisor domain external interrupt. The enable bits in
`msdeie` do not affect the S- and VS-level external interrupt pending signals
from the interrupt controller selected by `msdcfg.SDICN`.

=== Machine and Supervisor Interrupt registers (`mip/mie` and `sip/sie`)

The `Smsdia` extension introduces the local supervisor domain external
interrupt (`LSDEI`). This interrupt is treated as a standard local
interrupt that is assigned to bit 16 in the `mip`, `mie`, `sip`, and `sie`
registers. The bit 16 in `mip` and `sip` is called `LSDEIP` and the same bit in
`mie` and `sie` is called `LSDEIE`. The `mideleg` register controls the
delegation of `LSDEI` to S-mode. This interrupt cannot be delegated to
VS-mode and bit 16 of `hideleg` is read-only zero.

The `mip.LSDEIP` bit is set to 1 if the bitwise logical AND of CSRs
`msdeip` and `msdeie` is nonzero in any bit. The `sip.LSDEIP` bit is set to 0 if
`LSDEI` is not delegated to S-mode otherwise it returns the value of the
`mip.LSDEIP` when read.

Multiple simultaneous interrupts destined for different privilege modes are
handled in decreasing order of destined privilege mode. Multiple simultaneous
interrupts destined for the same privilege mode are handled in the following
decreasing default priority order: high-priority RAS event, MEI, MSI, MTI,
LSDEI, SEI, SSI, STI, SGEI, VSEI, VSSI, VSTI, LCOFI, low-priority RAS event.

[NOTE]
====
The RDSM may use the supervisor domain external interrupt to determine if a
supervisor domain has become ready to run since it was last descheduled. When a
supervisor domain that has a supervisor domain interrupt controller directly
assigned to it, the RDSM updates the `msdcfg.SDICN` to select that interrupt
controller and may clear the bit corresponding to that interrupt controller in
`msdeie` prior to resuming execution of the supervisor domain.

The RDSM may delegate `LSDEI` to a supervisor domain that may be entrusted by
the RDSM to get notified about supervisor domain external interrupts pending for
one or more other supervisor domains. Typically, this use case involves a single
supervisor domain that is trusted by the RDSM to receive such notifications. The
delegation supports optimizing the exit sequence from such supervisor domain by
enabling such supervisor domains to voluntarily yield execution in response to
pending interrupts for the other supervisor domains.
